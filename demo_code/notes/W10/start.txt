Route Handlers
    App object methods:
        get, post, put/patch, delete, all, use
    Request path options:
        string, array of strings, (regular expressions, array of regex, array of strings and regex)
    Middleware:
        Series of callback functions
        (more in D2)
    Response methods:
        send (used for plain text or JSON)
            Will be almost exclusively used for sending plain text
        json (always send JSON)
            set the heads and formatting for us

        ** These are for server-side html rendering, so we won't be using them
        render
        redirect

app.<method>(<path>, <middleware>, (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body)
})


Note that/if req.body is showing undefined, in order to access the body of the request, we have to add some boilerplate middleware to the top of our app.js file
    app.use(express.json())
