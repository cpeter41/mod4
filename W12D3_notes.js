Security

CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    Allows other apps to send requests to our API
    CORS policies are just middleware
    !! Enforced by the browser !!

XSS Attacks - Cross-Site Scripting
    Being able to inject code into someone else's site
    Often used for malicious intent, but not always
        Myspace is a great example
