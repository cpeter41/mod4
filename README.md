# mod-4-cohort-repo-skeleton

## At the start of a new cohort
When a new cohort starts, go into a/A Open for the cohort and clone down all of the practices for each week into the appropriate directory. This allows students to immediately work on the Short Practices without having to clone down each practice.

The students will still have to create a repo and clone down the Long Practices with their pairs.

## During lecture
All walkthroughs of SP will take place in the *instructor_practices* directory.
If the students want to, they should work in the *student_practices* directory, and *NOT* the *instructor_practices* directory. This will prevent any merge conflicts when they go to pull down the notes.
